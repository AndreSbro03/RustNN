# RustNN
Inspired by Tsodin Porject ( **https://youtu.be/PGSba51aRYU?si=QogqQE1VkJ9B_6Uy** ) this is a rudimental DeepLearning algorithm that I make just to try Rust.

I used raylib ( **https://www.raylib.com/** ) to manage the window.

It can learn how to resolve any type of logicGates combinations or learn how to store an image in the states of the NN.

Abbandoned.
