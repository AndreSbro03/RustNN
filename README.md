# RustNN
Inspired by Tsodin Porject ( **youtube.com/watch?v=PGSba51aRYU** ) this is a rudimental DeepLearning algorithm in Rust that I make just to try rust.

I used raylib ( **https://www.raylib.com/** ) to manage the window.

It can learn how to resolve any type of logicGates combinations or learn how to store an image in the states of the NN.

Abbandoned.
